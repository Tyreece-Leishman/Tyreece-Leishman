  <summary><h3>ðŸ§  Coding Journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey began when I right-clicked to inspect an element for the first time, without fully understanding its significance. I then searched online and learned how to modify text and change colors on a website. It was an exciting way to impress my friends. However, when I refreshed the page, all my changes reverted to their original state. This piqued my interest in creating my own website. I turned to Google for guidance on how to build a website for beginners, and that's when I discovered FreeCodeCamp. This website provided a step-by-step guide to web development, and it was there that I learned HTML and CSS. I also turned to YouTube to explore what more I could do with these languages, and that's when I stumbled upon the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel, which proved to be a great resource that I continue to use. As I progressed, I started working on independent projects to enhance my skills. Finally, I purchased a book titled 'Responsive Web Design,' and I'm currently working through the exercises in the book to learn best practices for responsive web design.
