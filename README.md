 <summary><h3>📌 Coding Journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey commenced during my time in secondary school when I accidentally stumbled upon the developer tools. Initially perplexed by the code displayed on the screen, I made a determined effort to comprehend it. My first attempt at hands-on coding involved manipulating CSS to change the colours of a webpage. However, my excitement was short-lived as I discovered that the changes did not persist after refreshing the page. This setback only fueled my curiosity and kindled a lasting interest in coding and web development.

Seeking to broaden my understanding, I turned to FreeCodeCamp, where I delved into the basics of HTML and CSS. As I refined my skills, I sought more comprehensive tutorials on YouTube, unlocking the intricacies of JavaScript and Python.

Fast forward to the present day, and my coding journey has progressed. I am currently engaged in Udemy courses, diligently working to enhance my coding abilities. As I tackle real-world projects, I find satisfaction in the ongoing learning process, propelled by the passion ignited during those initial moments in secondary school.
