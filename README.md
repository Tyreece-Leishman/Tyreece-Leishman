  <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Tyreece's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey as a curious computer science student with a passion to explore the world of programming. My initial interests included iOS development, but soon, I delved into Java, landing a full-stack software engineering job after graduation.

  However, another passion emerged - YouTube content creation. I decided to take the leap and focus on YouTube full-time, which has been my primary endeavor since.

  Throughout my journey, one dream always lingered - to build my own app or product. It's time to get uncomfortable and pursue that dream. In 2023, I'll be taking steps to turn that dream into a reality.

  Stay tuned, because I'm coming back to my roots as a developer and creator.
