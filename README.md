 <summary><h3>Coding Journey</h3></summary>

My coding journey has been interesting, it started with the building blocks of the web HTML through I learnt with freecodecamp. I remember crafting my first cat photo app, as I began understanding the structuring of content. Next, I explored some CSS by crafting a coffee menu, honing my skills in styling and design. As I learnt more and more I developed a solid grasp of HTML and CSS and worked on various projects which can be found in my repositories. lastly I experimented with JavaScript by adding functionality to my projects.
